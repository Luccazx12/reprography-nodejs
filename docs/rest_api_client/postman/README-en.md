## POSTMAN

### What is Postman:

Postman is a tool that supports documentation of api requests. It has an environment for documentation, testing APIs, and requests in general.

By using it, you'll start working with APIs more efficiently, building requests quickly, and you can save them for later use, and you'll be able to analyze the responses sent by the API.

A good reason to use this tool is that through it, you can dramatically reduce the time required to test and develop APIs.

In a practical example, imagine that you want to make a GET request to look for certain information in the company name.

If this were the case with testing a GET request without using Postman, you would need to write all the code to execute the request, plus a visual interface to interact with this routine.

If granted, you would probably need to write all of this to create a functional application using this API, but all this work would simply be to test its functionality, which in fact, in this format, is tedious and time-consuming.

### Why use Postman ?

In addition to being a free and easy-to-learn application, with little time you will be sending your first requests (requests/ requests). In addition, it is a tool with broad support for all APIs and Schemas.

### Creating a Collection:

Collection is the place where all developed codes are stored.

To create a collection, simply click Collection:

## Importing a Collection:
We put this sample URL for import, which will be used in the future
```bash 
https://www.getpostman.com/collections/0c9b504d153a377db01a
```
You can import from the home screen

![import6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71890228/142638750-ae4c91fd-1fc0-45f2-9456-d5956a4569d4.png)

Now just click "Import" in the upper left corner of the screen

![import2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71890228/142635964-49db79fc-86d1-4797-8b3a-d84ccd63217c.png)

Click "Import from Link" and paste the sample URL, then click "continue"

![import3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71890228/142636416-14d76417-567d-4a82-bccf-050ef548acf0.png)

Click "Import", the available collections will appear in the left corner

![import4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71890228/142636674-13bca015-23be-4408-becf-6edff01fa90f.png)

At the end a collection called "DEFAULT" will appear, where all request options will be available

![import5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71890228/142637406-732b61cc-46a6-4ff0-ad80-07263c856664.png)

So we finished importing Collection via Postman.
