### What is a Rest API ?

##### Before introducing the concept of Rest API, it is necessary to explain what an API is â€” Application Programming Interface. It is a set of requests that allow data communication between applications. For that, the API uses HTTP requests responsible for the basic operations necessary for the data manipulation. The main requests are:

* #### POST: create data on server;
* #### GET: read data from host;
* #### DELETE: delete information;
* #### PUT: Record updates.

##### Rest, which is the abbreviation of Representational State Transfer, is a set of restrictions used so that HTTP requests meet the guidelines defined in the architecture.
