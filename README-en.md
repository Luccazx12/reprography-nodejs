## :arrow_forward: How to start the application:

#### Requirements

- Node.js (v14.18.1)
- NPM (6.14.15)

 * Clone or download the repository<br>
 * Then extract the .config folder located in info_api/docs to /src <br>
 * Change the information regarding the database connection (.config/db.config.json)<br>
 * Create the database that inserted this file in your database (mysql/mariadb) - example: bdrepro <br>
 * Change the information regarding sending email (.config/mailer.config.json)


### Installing the packages

Run the command below to install the dependencies:
``` bash
npm install
```

### Starting the server

Run the command below to start Nodejs and connect to the database:
``` bash
npm run
```

Wait for execution and it will be running on the URL `http://localhost:3002`
<br>

And so you will have your application running locally.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Endpoints

By creating the documentation with Swagger, we were able to simplify not only the development of our API and the squad as a whole, but also the relationship with the other parts of the project (front-end squad, infra...). That's why we tried our best to make it self-explanatory and complete.

API documentation (Swagger) running at: `http://localhost:3002/docs/`

### Business rules:

- A user can only request a copy if he is authenticated (logged in);
- Only a user identified as ADMIN can register users;
- Users who are not ADMIN can only view the reproductions made by their own account;
- All users (either ADMIN or Normal user) can only evaluate orders placed by their own account;
- All services have pre-established quantities and when they reach 0, it will not be possible to request the reprography that contains that service (example: A3 & Black and White);
- Only users with different NIFS and E-mails will be registered.
- Only files whose extension is an image (.jpeg, .jpg, .png...) can be uploaded to the user profile image. And for the attachment, only files such as: .PDF, .DOCX and .XLSX will be accepted;
- You need two Services from the "services" table to place an order. And it is also necessary that neither of these two services have their quantity exhausted (<= 0);
- An order can only be placed if the multiplication of the number of copies with the number of pages entered by the user is smaller (<) than the quantity of the two services;
- An order can only be evaluated if it exists and has not yet been evaluated;
- A user can only login if they have their account activated;
- Every user on their first access needs to enter a new password for their account, updating the system default password for users created by management (senai115).
