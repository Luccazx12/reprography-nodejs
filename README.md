The MySQL database was hosted on MariaDB.
Routes were secured through JWT in conjunction with Swagger.

  * Express 4.17.1 - It is a framework for Node.js that provides minimal resources for building web servers.
  * Swagger-autogen 2.11.2
  * Nodemon 2.0.13 - To restart the server whenever there is a change.
  * Jwt - To protect private routes.
  * Bcrypt 5.0.1 - To Encrypt user passwords before saving to bank.
  * Cors 2.8.5 - It is a mechanism used by browsers to share resources between different sources
  * Multer 1.4.2 - It is a node.js middleware to handle multipart, which is mainly used to upload files.
  * Body-Parser 1.19.0 - Parses the JSON encoded data, buffer, string and URL sent using the HTTP POST request.
  * MariaDB 2.5.4 - It's the database we use.
  * PostMan - Testing the functionality of the created API.

#### Database Service

## :arrow_forward: How to start the application:

 * First download the zipped Config folder from info_api/ <br>
 * Extract it into the API directory (/src)
 * Change the information regarding the database connection (db.config.json )<br>
 * Create the database you inserted in this file (example: bdrepro)<br>
 * Change the information regarding sending email (mailer.config.json)
 
#### Requirements

- Node.js (v14.18.1)
- NPM (6.14.15)

### Installing the packages

Run the command below to install the dependencies:
``` bash
npm install
```

### Starting the server

Run the command below to start Nodejs and connect to the database:
``` bash
npm run
```

Wait for execution and it will be running on URL  `http://localhost:3002`
<br>

And so you will have your application running locally.

### Business rules:

- A user can only request a copy if he is authenticated (logged in);
- Only a user identified as ADMIN can register users;
- Users who are not ADMIN can only view the reproductions made by their own account;
- All users (either ADMIN or Normal user) can only evaluate orders placed by their own account;
- All services have pre-established quantities and when they reach 0, it will not be possible to request the reprography that contains that service (example: A3 & Black and White);
- Only users with different NIFS and E-mails will be registered.
- Only files whose extension is an image (.jpeg, .jpg, .png...) can be uploaded to the user profile image. And for the attachment, only files like: .PDF, .DOCX and .XLSX will be accepted.
- You need two Services from the "services" table to place an order. And it is also necessary that neither of these two services have their quantity exhausted ( <= 0)
- An order can only be placed if the multiplication of the number of copies with the number of pages entered by the user is smaller (<) than the quantity of the two services.
- An order can only be evaluated if it exists and has not yet been evaluated.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Endpoints

With our documentation made with Swagger, we were able to simplify the development of our API, through the set and tools that Swagger itself makes available to us, helping to design and document APIs at scale.
